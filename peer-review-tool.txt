# How to push a person through to the next step (without waiting for all reviews)

eg. FS is holding up JM. But JM was also reviewed by CG.

1. Set a manual ``Achievement`` instance for the submitted/learner [JM] (who is being
   held up) by their reviewer [FS]. Therefore give '[19] all_reviews_from_peers_completed' to JM. Make notes.
2. Generate an EvaluationReport for the submitter [JM], so they can see their
   feedback from the reviewer(s) that were able to complete their reviews.

   Open the review report from the reviewer who has dropped out [FS], and select
   their peer review in the overview page.
   Click "Submit", and this will generate their EvaluationReport. Ensure you put a message that this is a blank review.


2. Set a manual ``Achievement`` instance for the learner in the course:
   'read_and_evaluated_all_reviews'

How to push a person through to the next step (without waiting for all reviews)

1. Set a manual ``Achievement`` instance for the submitted/learner (who is being
   held up) by their reviewer, with '[19] all_reviews_from_peers_completed'.
   Make notes.


2. Immediately go generate an EvaluationReport for the submitter, so they can
   see their feedback from the reviewer(s) that were able to complete their
   reviews.

   Do this by going to the admin page, and open the review report from the
   reviewer who has dropped out, and select their peer review in the overview
   page. Fill in the maximum grades, and a comment that it has been forced
   completed.


   This review was not completed by the student. It was forced-completed after
   the due date, to allow the submitter to continue on with their work.
   Grading has been done in the submitter's favour.


   Click "Submit", and this will generate their EvaluationReport.


2. Set a manual ``Achievement`` instance for the learner in the course:
   'read_and_evaluated_all_reviews'


# How to 'remove' a report from the system. E.g. a poor submission.
1. Go to the submission and uncheck "is_valid"
2. Go find the Membership where the person is the submitter. Set fixed=False.
3. Go to the Achievements for the student, and withdraw that achievement for submitting.
