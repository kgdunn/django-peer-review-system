Hi there,

This is to inform you that there is a peer review for you to start in the course: {{course}}.
This is in regards to the deliverable: "{{deliverable}}".

You, and others in the course have submitted documents for review. Let's start reviewing!

1. Write your review (if you haven't done so already), so that you can see the incoming review(s).
2. Once you have finished you are also required to evaluate the reviews you receive.
3. Please don't delay. The document to review can be lengthy, and cannot be properly reviewed if you leave it until just before the deadline.

You should use this link: {{platform_link}} (you may have to copy and paste it manually, in the case your email software blocks it).

Remember: we don't use passwords, so you might first have to sign-in with a
valid email address for the above link to work.

Best regards,
The Peer Review System
