<p>There are some important points to note about the electronic peer review tool that will be used in this course.

<ol>
<li> You will upload PDF documents to be reviewed by other students that are also taking this course.
<li> You will also review your peers, supplying ratings and comments to them.
<li> You will receive email reminders, at your TU Delft email address, to let you know there is an evaluation due, or an assessment due. We also use that email address for you to sign into the system because <b>we do not use any passwords</b>.
</ol>
<p>To use this system you are agreeing to sharing the above information from points 1, 2 and 3 with the website that electronically handles the process.
