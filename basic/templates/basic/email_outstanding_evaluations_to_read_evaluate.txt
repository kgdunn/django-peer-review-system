Hi there,

Just a note about some outstanding work you have to complete in {{course}}.

You have submitted a document, and it has been reviewed by peers. The next
step is that you read and evaluate their reviews.

You can click on this link to go ahead with that: {{platform_link}}

Remember: we don't use passwords, so you might first have to sign-in with your
valid email address for that link to work.

Best regards,
The Interactive Peer Review System
