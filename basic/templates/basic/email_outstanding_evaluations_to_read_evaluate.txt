Hi there,

Just a note about some outstanding work you have to complete in the course: {{course}}.
This is in regards to the deliverable: "{{deliverable}}".

You have submitted a document, and it has been reviewed by {{N_peers}} peer{{N_peers|pluralize}} already. The next steps are:

1. Write your outgoing reviews (if you haven't done so already), so that you can see the incoming review(s).
2. Read and evaluate these incoming reviews of your work.
3. Write a rebuttal to your peers; this can take some time, so please don't delay.

Your peers need your rebuttal so they can continue onto their next steps also. Please don't hold each other up.

You should use this link: {{platform_link}} (you may have to copy and paste it manually in the case your email software blocks it)

Remember: we don't use passwords, so you might first have to sign-in with a
valid email address for that link to work.

Best regards,
The Interactive Peer Review System
